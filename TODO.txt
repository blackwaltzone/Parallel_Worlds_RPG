DONE:
- switched ScreenManager to static class
	- consequences? ****************
- map transitions
- hit switches
	- apparently stay switched when switching screens (GOOD)
- load map from file
- player automatically moves when transitioning
- updated collision detection
- fixed exit dialog (wouldn't cancel on Esc)
- added blocks
	- collision detection for blocks vs objects
	- out of bounds detection
- animated text
- why can't content manager reload map???
	- used Reset() method to reset switches and chests
